## Context

Our SaaS application needs a production database that can:
- Handle relational data with complex queries
- Scale to 100K users in first year
- Support full-text search
- Comply with SOC2 requirements
- Run on-premise or cloud

## Decision

**Selected: PostgreSQL 15**

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database for the following reasons:

1. **Proven reliability** - Battle-tested by companies at our scale
2. **Rich feature set** - JSONB, full-text search, advanced indexing
3. **Open source** - No vendor lock-in, strong community
4. **Compliance ready** - Meets SOC2 audit requirements
5. **Team expertise** - Our senior engineers have 5+ years PostgreSQL experience

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL
- **Pros**: Team familiarity, good performance
- **Cons**: Limited JSON support, less robust transaction handling
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL's JSONB and advanced features outweigh MySQL's simplicity

### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, good for rapid prototyping
- **Cons**: Compliance concerns for our use case, less mature transaction support
- **Decision**: Our data is fundamentally relational; PostgreSQL better fit

### Amazon Aurora
- **Pros**: Managed service, auto-scaling
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, higher cost, customer requires on-premise option
- **Decision**: Customer's on-premise requirement eliminates cloud-only solutions

## Impact

### Engineering
- **Migration plan**: 6 weeks to migrate from prototype SQLite
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for dev, managed service for production
- **Team training**: 2 engineers already expert, 3 need training

### Product
- **Launch timeline**: No impact - aligns with Q2 launch
- **Features enabled**: Advanced search, complex reporting
- **User experience**: Faster queries, better reliability

### Operations
- **Backup strategy**: Daily automated backups, 30-day retention
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **Incident response**: 24/7 on-call rotation

## Success Metrics

- Query performance: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- Uptime: 99.9% availability
- Compliance: Pass SOC2 audit
- Team proficiency: All engineers trained within 3 months
