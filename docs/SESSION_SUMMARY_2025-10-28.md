# Session Summary - 2025-10-28

## Goal

The primary goal of this session was to get the Phase 2 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality working for the SME Knowledge Graph application.

## Initial State

The application was running the Phase 1 code, and the RAG functionality was not implemented. The user was expecting the application to answer questions based on the documents in the `knowledge-vault`, but it was not working.

## Key Steps

1.  **Identified and fixed the application's entry point:** We discovered that the Docker container was running the Phase 1 Python script (`app.py`) instead of the Phase 2 script (`app_phase2.py`). We corrected this by updating the `app.py` file with the Phase 2 code.
2.  **Resolved ChromaDB connection issues:** We went through a lengthy debugging process to fix the connection between the chatbot and the ChromaDB server. This involved:
    *   Correcting the `HttpClient` instantiation arguments.
    *   Aligning the client (`chromadb` library) and server (`chromadb/chroma` Docker image) versions to `0.4.22`.
    *   Downgrading the `numpy` library in the `chromadb` container to a version compatible with `chromadb==0.4.22`.
3.  **Improved the RAG system's accuracy:** We identified that the model was not extracting the correct date from a document due to a lack of context in the retrieved chunks. We improved the chunking strategy by prepending the document title to each chunk, which provides more context to the LLM.
4.  **Updated the documentation:** We updated the `README.md` file with a screenshot of the working Phase 2 application.

## Final State

The application is now working as expected for Phase 2. The chatbot can connect to ChromaDB, index the knowledge vault, and answer questions based on the content of the documents, with source citations.

## Learning Points

*   **Version Alignment is Critical:** The biggest challenge we faced was the version mismatch between the `chromadb` client and server. This highlights the importance of explicitly defining and aligning the versions of all components in a distributed system.
*   **Debugging in Docker:** We learned how to debug issues within Docker containers by inspecting logs (`docker logs`) and iteratively modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file.
*   **Chunking Strategy Matters:** We saw firsthand how the chunking strategy can significantly impact the quality of a RAG system. Providing more context in each chunk (e.g., by adding the document title) can greatly improve the LLM's ability to generate accurate answers.
*   **The Importance of a Test Plan:** We concluded the session by outlining a comprehensive test strategy, which is a crucial step for ensuring the quality and reliability of any AI application.
