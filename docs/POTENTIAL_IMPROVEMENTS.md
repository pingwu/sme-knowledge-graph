# Potential Improvements for Phase 2

This document outlines potential improvements for the Phase 2 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## 1. Advanced Chunking Strategies

The current chunking strategy (splitting by paragraph and prepending the title) is a good start, but it can be improved.

*   **Recursive Character Text Splitting:** This method tries to keep paragraphs, then sentences, then words together as long as possible, which can be more effective than just splitting by paragraph.
*   **Semantic Chunking:** Instead of splitting by a fixed size, we can split the text based on semantic meaning, using the embedding model itself to identify where the topic changes.
*   **Handling Tables and Code Blocks:** The current chunking strategy does not handle tables and code blocks well. We should investigate methods to parse these elements and store them in a structured way in the vector database.

## 2. Two-step Retrieval Process

To improve accuracy, we can implement a two-step retrieval process:

1.  **Document Retrieval:** First, identify the most relevant document(s) for the user's query.
2.  **Chunk Retrieval:** Then, perform a more focused search for the most relevant chunks *within* those documents.

This can help to prevent the model from getting confused by context from irrelevant documents.

## 3. Prompt Engineering

We can experiment with different prompt templates to improve the LLM's performance.

*   **More Specific Instructions:** We can provide more specific instructions to the LLM on how to handle the provided context, how to extract specific information (like dates), and how to synthesize information from multiple sources.
*   **Handling "I don't know":** We can explicitly instruct the model to say "I don't know" if the answer is not in the provided context.

## 4. Evaluation Framework

To systematically test the RAG system's performance, we should implement the evaluation framework we discussed.

*   **Create an Evaluation Dataset:** A set of questions with their expected answers and sources.
*   **Automate the Evaluation:** A script that runs the questions against the RAG system and compares the results to the expected answers.
*   **Track Metrics:** Track metrics like Answer Relevancy, Faithfulness, Context Precision, and Context Recall.

## 5. Automated Testing

We should implement the unit and integration tests we planned to ensure the application's reliability and to prevent regressions.

*   **Unit Tests:** For chunking logic, API connections, etc.
*   **Integration Tests:** For the full indexing and RAG pipelines.
